# OFFICE - HANGMAN

A hangman word guessing game, written in Ruby, built into a simple web app
using Sinatra, and hosted on Heroku, here: [https://office-hangman.herokuapp.com/](https://hangman-sinatra.herokuapp.com/).


In this version of hangman, you try to guess the title of random episodes from tv show ["The Office"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)).

I utilize the [IMDB API](https://imdb-api.com/) in order to query and utilize episode data from the tv series, including
a random episode's title, the season number for the episode, a description of the episode's plot, and a
link to an image from that episode.

This was made in the effort to rebuild my final project for Stanford's CS106A
(which I took in the form of [Code In Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/),
a fantastic introduction to coding). I wanted to build this simple game once
again, this time from scratch and without boilerplate, as a webapp with expanded features.
