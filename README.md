# HANGMAN

A hangman word guessing game, written in Ruby, built into a simple web app
using Sinatra, and hosted on Heroku.

This was made in the effort to rebuild my final project for Stanford's CS106A
(which I took in the form of [Code In Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/),
a fantastic introduction to coding). I wanted to build this simple game once
again, this time from scratch and without boilerplate, as a simple webapp.

This is a work in progress, and you can play at
